## Running participant code challenge tests

Due to a known GitHub classroom quirk, it seems you can only add remote repo tests and have them run successfully if the participant has already cloned their repo for that code challenge.  

- Once they have been submitted, go to `Techtonica Classroom > code-challenge-specificnumber > Edit Assignment > Grading and Feedback > Edit`.  
- Click the "Edit" button in Grading and Feedback, then click "Save this test case", then "Update assignment".  We should already have entered the test criteria, but for some reason it only works after the participant repo has been created, not before. This action should trigger test updates as though it were newly added.
- Participant repos should re-run their tests in a few seconds with the correct script.  You should now be able to see whether they pass by clicking `Techtonica Classroom > code-challenge-specificnumber > Review` for the participant.
