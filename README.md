## Troubleshooting

- `4 specs, 0 failures  Finished in 0.009 seconds`:
  No failures - they all passed!

- `SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')'`:
  This most likely means your return statement is empty.  Start entering your code in today's "challenges" file.

  Another problem could be that your parenthesis don't match perfectly.
