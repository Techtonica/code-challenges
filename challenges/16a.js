// Create a function that will print a statement about animals and their young.  The function animals() should accept two array arguments of equal length, so that calling:
//
// animals(["dog", "cat", "horse"], ["pups", "kittens", "foals"]);
//
// should return this string:
//
// `Young dogs are called pups Young cats are called kittens Young horses are called foals `
//
// Example 1:
//
// animals(["dog", "cat", "horse"], ["pups", "kittens", "foals"]);
//
// --->
//
//  \`Young dogs are called pups Young cats are called kittens Young horses are called foals \`
//
// Example 2:
//
// animals(["cow", "eagle", "deer"], ["calves", "chicks", "fawns"]);
//
// --->
//
//  \`Young cows are called calves Young eagles are called chicks Young deers are called fawns \`
//
// Note:  Since this one isn't too difficult, solve this as though it were part of a live interview.
// What would you say as you are working through it?

function animals(adults, young){
  // your code here
